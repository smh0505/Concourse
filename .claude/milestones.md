# Milestones

Tracks *what's done*. For implementation rationale, decisions, and fixes behind each item,
see `.claude/devlog.md`.

**1.0.0** marks Milestones 1–14 (the core roadmap) closed and the app considered stable for
real-world use. Further work continues under **Post-1.0 Roadmap** at the bottom of this file,
numbered as a continuing milestone sequence for the same devlog cross-reference convention.

## Milestone 1 — Core Library Foundation
- [x] Pick stack (Tauri + Vue/TypeScript, SQLite)
- [x] Set up SQLite schema (games, tags, playtime sessions)
- [x] Manual "add game" flow (name + executable path)
- [x] Grid view UI listing added games
- [x] Launch button (spawn process from path)

## Milestone 2 — Metadata & Playtime
- [x] Integrate SteamGridDB API for cover art
- [x] Integrate IGDB for genre/description/release date
- [x] Manual metadata edit/override UI

- [x] Plugin loader (discover/load modules at runtime)
- [x] Plugin manifest format
- [x] Settings UI to enable/disable installed plugins

## Milestone 5 — Theme/Skin Plugins
- [x] Define `ThemePlugin` interface (component-slot overrides + activate/deactivate)
- [x] Add `kind` field to plugin manifest
- [x] Slot registry for swappable UI regions
- [x] Theme store, persisted active theme id
- [x] Settings UI: exclusive theme picker

## Milestone 6 — First Source Plugin (Steam)
- [x] Parse `libraryfolders.vdf` for install locations
- [x] Parse appmanifest files for owned/installed games
- [x] Map Steam entries into core `GameEntry` format
- [x] Dedup against manually-added games
- [x] Test end-to-end: scan → library → launch → playtime

## Milestone 7 — Polish & Extras
- [x] List view for desktop UI
- [x] Metadata provider plugin support (new `metadata` plugin kind)
- [x] Controller mapping profile plugins
- [x] Background art on focus (Big Picture)
- [x] Additional source plugins — Epic Games, GOG (ROM scanner moved to Milestone 15)
- [x] Big Picture scroll fixes (hidden scrollbar, desktop scroll lock)
- [x] Auto-launch into Big Picture on boot (toggle)
- [x] Per-game compatibility wrappers (Locale Remulator + Locale Emulator)
- [x] Playtime tracking for URI-launched games (Steam/Epic/GOG)

## Milestone 8 — Remote/Downloadable Plugins (future)
Pivoted to WASM — see devlog.
- [x] Embed a WASM runtime (`wasmtime`, Component Model); define WIT world for `SourcePlugin`
- [x] Host-function capability surface (registry/file/process/network primitives)
- [x] DB access stays host-owned (`settings`/`plugin_data`, never raw SQL)
- [x] Download command (paste a URL, verify checksum, extract)
- [x] Load/instantiate pipeline (Tauri commands calling into a loaded `.wasm` component)
- [x] Loader integration (WASM manifests merged alongside build-time TS ones)
- [x] Reference example (`examples/exe-scanner-plugin`), tested end-to-end
- [x] Revisit `tauri.conf.json` CSP
- [x] (Stretch) Migrate Steam to a WASM plugin as a real-world proof

## Milestone 9 — Further WASM Adoption (stretch)
- [x] Migrate GOG and Epic to WASM plugins, retire built-in `gog.rs`/`epic.rs`
- [x] Rename `steam-wasm` → `steam` display name (id unchanged) across all 7 plugin repos
- [x] External theme plugins: data-only tier (`cssVariables`, install-by-URL, no code/WASM)
- [x] Review component-override tier (`slots`) for external feasibility — blocked at the time;
  tracked separately as Milestone 17 (Post-1.0 Roadmap)
- [x] Migrate SteamGridDB and IGDB metadata providers to WASM plugins, retire built-in
  `sgdb.rs`/`igdb.rs`

(Locale Remulator/Locale Emulator's WASM migration moved into Milestone 10.)

## Milestone 10 — LR/LE Managed Install + WASM Migration
See devlog for context on why these two workstreams are combined.

**Managed install.**
- [x] Rust command to fetch latest release download URL (GitHub API)
- [x] Download + zip extraction into an app-data-managed directory
- [x] Auto-fill wrapper paths after extraction
- [x] "Install" button in `AppSettings`
- [x] Integrity check before extracting

**WASM migration.**
- [x] Design a `wrapper`-shaped WIT interface/plugin kind
- [x] Port LR/LE's launch logic into WASM plugins
- [x] Wire the new `wrapper` plugin kind into loader/settings UI

## Milestone 11 — RAWG Metadata Provider (stretch)
Follows the M9 SGDB/IGDB precedent — ships as a standalone WASM plugin repo, not built-in.
- [x] `rawg-metadata-wasm-plugin` repo
- [x] Verify for real against a live API key, fetching real metadata
- [x] Verify merge behavior against IGDB (first-non-null-wins)

(Milestone 12, Xbox/EA/Ubisoft source plugins, moved to Post-1.0 Roadmap, Milestone 16 — none
of its items were started, no reason to hold up 1.0 for a stretch goal untouched.)

## Milestone 13 — WASM Plugin Capability Sandboxing (security)
Install-by-URL for WASM source plugins granted the same real-world system access as running an
arbitrary downloaded `.exe` — see devlog for the gap.
- [x] Interim: honest risk warning in the install confirmation UI and README
- [x] Path allowlisting for file/registry host primitives
- [x] Permission gating for `spawn-process`/`run-and-wait`
- [x] URL allowlisting/rate-limiting for `http-request`/`http-get`/`download-bytes`

Milestone 13 fully closed - all four items done.

## Milestone 14 — Plugin Trust Model: Signing & Review (stretch)
Even with Milestone 13 done, install-by-URL stayed trust-based, not verified — see devlog.
- [x] Code signing for published plugin releases (Sigstore attestation, advisory not a hard
  install-time gate)
- [x] Curated/reviewed plugin registry (`concourse-plugin-registry`, hash-pinned, hard reject
  on mismatch)
- [x] Revocation mechanism (pulling a registry entry *is* revocation, install-time only)

Milestone 14 fully closed - all three bullets done. See devlog for the registry's own
version-bump automation (dispatch on release → re-hash → PR), added after the milestone closed.

## Milestone 14.5 — UI Polish (Continuous, ongoing)
This milestone doesn't close — UI polish is open-ended. See devlog for detail on each item;
new items get appended in place rather than opening a new milestone. Numbered 14.5 (not 9)
since it sits alongside/after the closed core roadmap rather than blocking any milestone in
sequence.
- [x] Custom window chrome
- [x] Navigation shell
- [x] Grid/list view toggle redesign
- [x] Collapsible sidebar
- [x] Themed scrollbars
- [x] Sidebar/titlebar rework (Add Game modal, Big Picture button relocation)
- [x] Design token pass
- [x] Play/Edit/Remove icon-only buttons
- [x] GameCard hover redesign
- [x] Toast/notification system
- [x] Empty/loading states
- [x] Modal polish
- [x] Big Picture visual pass
- [x] Big Picture slideshow view
- [x] API-key/settings forms moved into modals; modal-form components consolidated under
  `src/components/desktop/modalForms/`
- [x] Big Picture tile title hidden by default, reveals on hover/selection
- [x] Long tile titles ellipsis instead of bleeding into neighboring tiles
- [x] Fixed keyboard/gamepad focus fighting the mouse cursor in Big Picture's grid (a tile's
  `mouseenter` firing when it moves under a stationary cursor, not just on real mouse movement)

Note: Milestone 3 (Big Picture) is sequenced before the plugin system to validate the
controller UX early. Milestone 4's loader only discovers plugins bundled into the app at
build time (`src/plugins/*`); Milestone 8 added true runtime-downloadable plugin support as
a distinct, larger feature.

# Post-1.0 Roadmap

Second wave of milestones, opened after 1.0.0 shipped. Numbering continues the same
sequence/heading convention as above for devlog cross-reference.

## Milestone 15 — Additional Source Plugins: Emulator/ROM Scanner
Carried over from Milestone 7 unstarted.
- [ ] Research emulator/ROM directory conventions worth supporting first
- [ ] Scan configured ROM directories, map entries into core `GameEntry` format
- [ ] Launch mechanism (emulator + ROM path)
- [ ] Dedup against manually-added / other source-plugin entries

## Milestone 16 — Additional Source Plugins: Xbox/EA/Ubisoft (stretch)
Carried over from Milestone 12 unstarted, in full.
- [ ] Xbox — research install detection and launch mechanism
- [ ] EA app — research install detection and launch mechanism
- [ ] Ubisoft Connect — research install detection and launch mechanism
- [ ] Each ships as its own WASM plugin in a separate repo from day one

## Milestone 17 — External Theme Plugins: JSON-AST Rendering Tier
Supersedes the original component-override design (blocked - see devlog legacy record). Ships
a constrained declarative template tier instead, measured against Brick Block's real gap.
- [x] Measure Brick Block's real gap against a template tier - small (a glyph swap, one wrapper
  element, missing CSS-variable hooks), no method-call/helper expressions needed
- [x] Decide the action-dispatch boundary - footer buttons stay host-rendered always, never
  themeable structure/callables
- [x] Prototype naive same-realm interpolation (`@vue/compiler-dom` + `new Function`) - verified
  a full sandbox escape for real, rejected outright
- [x] Evaluate Web Worker isolation - structurally sound but superseded before being built
- [x] Design and build the JSON-AST interpreter instead (`src/theme/cardVisualAst.ts`/
  `cardVisualRegistry.ts`) - no `eval`/`with`/`new Function` anywhere, so no code-execution
  primitive exists to escape from. 4 node types, closed field/transform enums, depth/node caps
- [x] Acceptance test against Brick Block's measured gap, plus interpreter safety tests (bad
  field, bad node type, depth/count overflow) - all pass
- [x] Sign the AST manifest itself for provenance, reusing the existing WASM-plugin signing path

Milestone 17 fully closed. `concourse-plugin-registry` extended to `kind: "theme"`
(`brick-block-data-theme` as first entry, hash-pinned and enforced same as WASM plugins - a gap
caught and fixed here, not shipped silently unenforced). Post-ship fidelity pass (from real use,
not just the acceptance test) fixed two real bugs (`cardVisual` silently dropped by the Rust
struct; several card/placeholder values still had no variable hooks), added
`--card-border-width`/`--card-radius`/`--cover-placeholder-*`/`--balloon-background` hooks, and
added a new `fontFaces` capability (real `@font-face` loading, strictly validated,
commit-pinned-URL only) since `cssVariables` can only select a font, never load one.

## Milestone 18 — Shared Styles Convention
Style-convention shift: less `<style scoped>` per component, more centralized shared CSS
(`src/styles.css`), prompted by Brick Block work repeatedly hitting hardcoded, unoverridable
values in individual components' scoped blocks.
- [x] Audit 22 components' scoped styles for real duplicate/hardcoded-token findings
- [x] Absorb `App.vue`'s `:root` token block and primitive-element resets into `styles.css`
- [x] Migrate identified duplicate patterns (shimmer, list-row, tag-pill, empty-state, Big
  Picture's backdrop cluster) into shared classes
- [x] Resolve off-token radius values, fold into the named scale (`--radius-panel` → `--radius-lg`,
  old `--radius-lg` → `--radius-xl`)
- [x] Migrate remaining unused-token findings (hardcoded borders/gaps/radii/colors → tokens)

Milestone 18 fully closed. Post-close follow-ups (see devlog for full detail): vestigial
now-empty local classes removed; `.hint` converted to primitive `<small>`; `.error` → shared
`.error-text`; a full button-styling consistency pass (two real bugs -
`.view-toggle-button`/`.icon-action-row` - plus a clean duplicate, a font-size fork collapsed to
one tier, and the `.active` accent-swap idiom, all folded into shared classes). `TitleBar.vue`'s
chromeless buttons and a `--space-*` tokenization pass remain open, deliberately unscoped.

## Milestone 19 — Retire Component-Swap Theming (in progress)
Milestone 17's JSON-AST/token mechanism was built to replace `slots`/component-swap theming;
this milestone finishes that job. `slotRegistry.ts`/`ThemeSlotName` currently have exactly one
real consumer (the built-in `brick-block-theme` plugin) - once that's gone, so is the whole
mechanism. See devlog for the full case and this session's prep work.
- [x] Prep: opt-in `--button-radius`/`--button-border-color` hooks added to the global `button`
  rule, closing the button-frame gap between `brick-block-data-theme` and the built-in swap
  version
- [x] Gave `BigPictureTile.vue` a `cardVisual`-AST render path, same pattern as `GameCard.vue`
  (`CardVisualRenderer`/`useActiveCardVisual`, second consumer of the same registry). Needed
  `overflow: hidden` added to the shared `.bp-cover-frame` first, since AST-rendered
  `.cover`/`.cover-placeholder` carry no radius of their own
- [x] Tokenized `BigPictureTile.vue`'s frame/title, closing the gap with Brick Block's always-
  visible chunky border: new opt-in `--tile-background`/`--tile-border-width`/
  `--tile-border-color` hooks on `.bp-cover-frame`, `--tile-title-font-family`/
  `--tile-title-text-shadow` on `.tile-title`
- [x] Ported Brick Block's Big Picture tile look to `brick-block-data-theme`'s manifest
  (`data-theme-plugins` repo, `1.2.3` → `1.3.0`) - the same `cardVisual` AST already covers the
  star-glyph swap for both desktop and Big Picture (one shared registry), so this pass only
  needed the new `--tile-*` hooks set: stripe background, `4px` border matching the card frame,
  pixel font + drop-shadow title
- [ ] Verify full parity between built-in `brick-block-theme` and the data-theme version
  (desktop card + Big Picture tile)
- [ ] Remove the built-in `brick-block-theme` plugin folder entirely
- [ ] Delete `slotRegistry.ts`, `ThemeSlotName`, `ThemePlugin.slots`, and every
  `useThemeSlot`/`setActiveSlots`/`clearActiveSlots` call site
- [ ] Verify clean build, no dangling imports, default Catppuccin theme unaffected
